    <h2>Week 2 - Ulises Carrión - Selections from Second Thoughts</h2>
When Ulises refers to old and new books, what exactly is he referring to? What's the cultural and artistic trend at the time?
And it's interesting to see the way Ulises writes the text reflects how he talks about the form of new art. In the book, there's an expression of the structure : ' ' ' ' , and one can literally read from anywhere and still make sense.

  <h2>Week 3 - Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully  </h2>
It's interesting to think about the ways in which websites are shaping our sense of self and our relationships with others. For example, one of my friends might build a web that showcases his love of travel and adventure, while downplaying other aspects of his life, such as the job or personal relationships. The web thus becomes a performance space where one construct the idealized selves to others in a highly selective way. Is that true image of ourselves? Is the dream or the ambitions we showcase real?
 <h2>
Week 4 - Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer
 </h2>
In the article published in 2014, the author talks about a potential hybrid of digital and print industry for the post-digital age. He illustrates some examples, like updating QR codes for selling books or customizing e-books for diverse printing, but somehow those didn’t seem to be a trend till today. 
 <h2>
Week 5 - Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s)
 </h2>
Different stories could be told in web design by adopting the relations between the signifier and the signified across different eras. The ways of defining hyperlinks would also lead to different user experiences. The one-on-one hyperlink is the most common used in web design to refer to an outside resource. It's rigorous and expected. The one to multiple relation as popularized in the postmodern age could be used to shown randomized results without an specific order or say hierarchy. The interaction between user and web is un-expected and surprised. With overarching structures as identified in the diagram of hypermodernism, one can design different stories lines from a main concept. In this situation, the user has his/her own control of where he/she goes while still enjoys certain degrees of freedom.
 <h2>
Week 6 - David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design
 </h2>
There are two concepts that stick out to me when I read the selections. The first is that we as human beings understand things in whole other than parts. (would be interested to know more of how this underlying understanding would affect a web design) And the second is when Susan explains the icons each by each the underlying psychology of how people would feel, interpret and use them. It's worth mentioning that both are helping a designer to convey the concept by beginning with a deep understanding of users' perception.

 <h2>
Week 8 - Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook
 </h2>
The discussion of text as an alternative description of image reminds me of the experience that I had when using Mid Journey and image search. On one hand, the text as mediators plays an critical role in finding the right picture in mind. On the other hand, the database is another determination. 
<br>
 <h2>
Week 10 -  Metahaven - White Night Before A Manifesto
 </h2>
The differences between a "surface" and a "territory" are interesting here and useful to think about the underlying dynamics beneath the everyday App we use. For example, Facebook's business model is based on the sale of this data to third-party advertisers and other organizations. This is what creates a complex web of relationships and power dynamics that are not immediately visible on the surface of the platform. 
 <h2>
Week 11 - Ramsey Nasser - Selections from Decolonising the Digits
 </h2>
It's a great article that reminds one of the power structure underlying the technology and of its importance from the educational perspective. As designers, we should imagine digital spaces where users have more control over their data and diverse perspectives are represented.
 <h2>
 Week 13 - Paul Soulellis - Performing the Feed
 </h2>
Soulellis's article reminds me of the time I use Instagram's Reel. The endlessness is designed to keep me engaged and addicted to the platforms. Because I don't know where the feed ends, it creates a sense of infinity that makes me feel curious and exciting. This, in turn, encourages me to keep scrolling and posting, creating a cycle of addiction that is difficult to break.
 <h2>
Week 14 - Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons
 </h2>
It is really an interesting and thought-provoking article and encourages me to see the invisible social and political issues underlying the Internet. We should think more critically about the limitations of our current methods of knowledge production.
 <h2>
 Week 15 - Wendy Hui Kyong Chun - On Software or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge
 </h2>
Chun explores the role of software in shaping our understanding of race and identity. She argues that software is not neutral, but rather is shaped by the biases and assumptions of its creators. Thus, we should be mindful that software can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and perpetuate inequalities. A more critical approach to the development of software, one that is aware of the potential biases, needed to be developed.
